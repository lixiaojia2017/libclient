## How to build

This application requires Qt 5.8 or higher to build. Presumably you are using a GUI operating system for this application, so you must have installed Qt Creator. In this case, open the *.pro project file and build it using Qt Creator.

If you prefer to build with command line, you can go as follows:

```bash
qmake && make
```

## Usage

This is a GUI application, just launch it after build! Do not tell me you can't use it.
